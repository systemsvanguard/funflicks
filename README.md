# Fun Flicks
A simple **API** demonstration leveraging the fantastic IMDB movie public API. This demo is a fun project and Covid-19 downtime skill builder for me, and utilizes React.js, an external API, Axios, Reach Router, CSS3, HTML5, and a bunch more technologies and accronyms that I may choose to throw at it later.  Hosted on a simple Apache PHP host (instead of my usual cloud platforms). A perpetual work in progress, and my excuse to go research movies.
